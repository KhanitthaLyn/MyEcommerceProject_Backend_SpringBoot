⚠️ This project reflects my real learning journey. Some parts of the code may not yet follow perfect clean-code standards, as my current priority is to deeply understand the full system behavior before performing large-scale refactoring.

⚠️ Refactoring is being done incrementally as my understanding of the system grows.
